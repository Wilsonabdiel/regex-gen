Sure, let's build a simple regular expression generator CLI tool using Python. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Set Up Your Project**: Create a new Python file for your project, e.g., `regex_generator.py`.

2. **Import Necessary Libraries**: For this project, you'll need the `argparse` library for handling command-line arguments and the `re` library for working with regular expressions.

```python
import argparse
import re
```

3. **Define Command-Line Arguments**: Use the `argparse` library to define the command-line arguments that your tool will accept. For this project, you might accept a list of test cases.

```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate a regular expression that matches all provided test cases.')
parser.add_argument('test_cases', type=str, nargs='+', help='A list of test cases to match.')
args = parser.parse_args()
```

4. **Generate the Regular Expression**: Write a function that takes the test cases and generates a regular expression. For simplicity, let's assume that all test cases are alphanumeric strings. Our regular expression will then be a sequence of character classes, one for each unique character in the test cases.

```python
def generate_regex(test_cases):
    regex = ''
    for test_case in test_cases:
        for char in test_case:
            if char.isalpha():
                regex += '[a-zA-Z]' if char.lower() == char else '[A-Z]'
            elif char.isdigit():
                regex += '[0-9]'
    return regex
```

5. **Output the Result**: Call your `generate_regex` function with the test cases provided by the user and print the result.

```python
regex = generate_regex(args.test_cases)
print(f'Regular expression: {regex}')
```

This is a very basic regular expression generator and won't handle many edge cases. For a more robust solution, you might want to look into existing libraries or tools¬π¬≤¬≥‚Å¥‚Åµ.

Please note that this code is a simple example and may not work for all inputs or use cases. Always test your code thoroughly and consider edge cases. Happy coding! üöÄ
